In the first half of the document, we will use 'babynames' dataset, which contains yearly information on the frequency of baby names by sex and is provided by the US Social Security Administration, to perform pattern matching. In the second half, we will use 'guttenbergr' pattern to do text analysis on the book "Call of the Wild" by Jack London. We will also do text analysis on four books by Charles Dickens.
